All steps are from the very helpful DataGrip site:
https://www.jetbrains.com/help/datagrip/connect-to-google-cloud-sql-instances.html#step-1-run-the-cloud-sql-proxy-client

First, install Datagrip (technically unnecessary, but it has nice data visualizations):
https://www.jetbrains.com/help/datagrip/installation-guide.html

Next, install Google Cloud CLI:
https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install

Then, set up Google Cloud:
./google-cloud-sdk/bin/gcloud init 
(follow prompts)

./google-cloud-sdk/bin/gcloud auth login
(go to Chrome, sign into google account)

./google-cloud-sdk/bin/gcloud auth application-default login
(essentially the same as before

Ask me to add your Google account to the cloud

THEN, install Cloud SQL Proxy Client.
Link: https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/connect-instance-auth-proxy#linux-64-bit
but steps are essentially as below

Run on a console in your Desktop

curl -o cloud-sql-proxy https://storage.googleapis.com/cloud-sql-connectors/cloud-sql-proxy/v2.11.4/cloud-sql-proxy.linux.amd64

and

chmod +x cloud-sql-proxy

Now, start up server with

./cloud-sql-proxy --port 3306 molten-album-427115-q6:us-central1:oyster1

If you get authenciation errors, check that you have followed all cloud steps above.

Now, go into DataGrip, click + under Database Explorer, select Datasource -> mySQL -> mySQL, then user as root, password as dbuserdbuser. That should be all! In addition, running commands in the Jupyter notebook should automatically be sent to the cloud (after changing port to 3306).
